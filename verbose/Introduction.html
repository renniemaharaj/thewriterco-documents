<h1 dir="auto">Introduction</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">The following axioms are built on the assumption that God is. We do not seek to prove His existence, nor do we believe that there is any way for us to do so. We assume that God is for this exploration.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">I have included the following verbose explanations for your reasoning and understanding, but not for proof.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">We will construct a system of logic from which we can explore the assumption that God is and derive answers to four fundamental questions concerning the initiator of creation and creation itself. If we cannot derive consistent results, then we know that the framework is flawed, and we will abandon it. If we can derive consistent results, then the framework is stable, much like many concepts in mathematics.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">We automatically reject any form of polytheism, pantheism, or atheism as they are either inconsistent with our constraints or cannot contribute to the derivation of answers to our four fundamental questions. None of these axioms is up for debate; they are assumed true for this exploration.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">While the outsider may argue that our framework is 'dogmatic' or 'blind' in its assumptions, we argue that the word 'dogmatic' is a negative word for the beautiful word 'faith', which is actually what this is. If you are under this framework, consider how those who demand proof blindly accept axioms in mathematics and similar scientific fields, and consider why.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Your faith is your proof. Your faith is valid and precious, akin to precious stones, but immaterial. If you are under this framework, I hope that you never feel the need to prove your faith when the works of your faith are evident in your life. Do not think that you can prove God. Either a soul chooses to believe or not. It is not complicated. It is simple. Consider why you choose to believe. Consider why a person will choose not to believe in God, but will not apply that demand for absolute proof to everything else in their life.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">To end this introduction, we assume that God is, that the KJV is our preferred written source of scripture, and that Jesus Christ is the Truth. None of the axioms in this framework are up for debate. This stance is imperative to adopt to defend those under this framework from the reach of the world; to defend a fragile faith from the world's demands for proof, signs, and wonders.</span></p>
