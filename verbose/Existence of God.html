<h1 dir="auto">Existence of God</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Assume as true: God is. It is impossible for any created being to transcend creation and directly verify an external source. However, we have only two possible cases: either God is or he is not. We do not seek to convince or prove to you that God is, but rather, we fully assume that God is for this exploration.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">If you cannot explore the assumption that God is, then nothing within this framework will satisfy you because we do not attempt to prove God. Rather, we seek to construct a logical system from which the answers to four primitive questions can be derived. In mathematics, no one proves that a point has no size or that parallel lines never meet in Euclidean space; these are just taken as given, but are required to construct a logical system. So why should the existence of God be treated differently?</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">The demand for proof presupposes that God's existence must be demonstrable like a scientific hypothesis, but what if God's existence is more like an axiomâ€”necessary to construct a logical system, and not derivable from something more fundamental?</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">While science suggests a beginning, our detailed observations also lead us to perceive one. However, beyond mere beginnings, we recognize evidence of intelligent design. Intelligence alone does not necessitate personality, but the nature of design suggests intentionality and purpose, which point to an initiator with personality. Based on this inference, we establish a framework to derive answers to four primitive questions concerning the initiator of creation and creation itself:</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Who created?</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">What was created?</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Why were these things created?</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">How was it all created?</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">;the questions of a man's heart.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">We assume that God exists because, without this assumption, deriving answers to all four questions becomes impossible. However, the answers to all four questions are essential for any sense of purpose. We cannot remain idle or buy into the distractions that distract us from asking these questions. No, these distractions are too costly, we cannot afford them, and we see through a system that enslaves us by our drive to afford these distractions. The end of the chase is emptiness. If these questions cannot be answered, then I have no drive to continue.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">We will derive the answers to all four questions in terms of the initiator of creation and creation itself. If we cannot derive consistent results, then we know that the framework is flawed, and we will abandon it. If we can derive consistent results, then the framework is stable, much like many concepts in mathematics.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">These four questions are required to be answered in terms of both creation and the initiator of creation since the single term, creation, is not sufficient by itself to derive the answers to all four questions, and we are determined to answer all four questions, but we must begin with the assumption that God is.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Having established that God is, and that creation is, we now declare the following constraints for the two terms: creation and initiator, and their relationship:</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Initiator is.</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Creation is.</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Initiator != equals creation.</span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">Initiator, ultimately, is one.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 26px">The assumed God equals the initiator since we define the initiator as an ultimate cause, the definition of God. That initiator is one. If there can be multiple initiators, their collaboration would require a higher governing cause, which itself must be singular and pre-existing. Thus, the initiator is necessarily one. We are not interested in proving or disproving the existence of God.</span></p>
