<h2 dir="auto">The authoritative written source</h2><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 18px">The KJV Bible is the complete and authoritative written source, the word of God, and is preferred first. Any conflicting translation—whether in character, word, verse, or chapter—is false. We have much information on the term: creation, so building on the first axiom, we have established, and in our quest to answer the four fundamental questions, we now gather and analyze the information we have about the second term: God (Initiator). This information comes from scripture, but first, we must determine which scripture is true, since many claim to be true yet contradict each other.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 18px">The true scripture must: Provide answers or pointers toward the answers to our four fundamental questions. They must be: internally consistent (without contradictions), consistent with the world around us (historically, prophetically, and doctrinally sound), and satisfy our constraints.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 18px">Among all religious texts, we have chosen scripture from the Christian faith as our lead. Within Christianity, the KJV Bible stands as the most consistent, historically sound, and doctrinally pure version. We do not attempt to prove the KJV Bible to be true; rather, we assume it as true for the purpose of this framework, while external arguments and sources are considered separately.</span></p>
