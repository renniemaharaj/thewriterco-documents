A Reflection on Matthew 6:25â€“34</h2><h3 dir="auto">Introduction</h3><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Hello reader, what is life? Or rather, who is life? I hope to answer this question by the end of this article or study. I'm basing my approach on a thought-provoking passage of scripture, a public speech by Jesus, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=Matthew&amp;c=6&amp;v=25&amp;o=1">Matthew Chapter 6, Verses 25 - 34</a>.</p><p dir="auto"></p><h3 dir="auto">Defining Life</h3><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>Therefore, I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">The above scripture, verse 25, opens with, "Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?" However, I want to expand on that life. I want to interpret these verses, specifically 'the life', with more context.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">We have a couple of contexts, or rather, senses, available to us.</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Eternal persistence and surety (Heavenly)</p></li><li><p dir="auto">The breath of life (Divine)</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Experiencing, seeing, and satisfying physical senses (Secular)</p></li></ol><h3 dir="auto">Eternal persistence and surety</h3><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This sense of life transcends both the breath of life and what the world refers to in the statement, "Live life". It is persisting with God after transitioning from the scope of the world (death as you would call it). I believe this is the life referred to by God in the passage <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=Genesis&amp;c=2&amp;v=17&amp;o=1">Genesis Chapter 2, Verse 17</a>.</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">I believe it was imperative for Adam not to know good from evil. I believe man's 'ego', 'sense of worth', and 'consciousness' were negatively affected by knowledge, and vulnerable to the pride of life. Thereby, introducing distance to God and the true Life wherein is all pure and undefiled righteousness before God.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Let us consider <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=John&amp;c=1&amp;v=1&amp;o=1">John Chapter 1, Verse 1</a></p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">How can this be? This passage of scripture, as the Christian Bible is notorious for, contradicts the fundamental laws of logic. How can a thing be with another, and be the thing at the same time? And consider the many occurrences where Jesus, the Son of God, is said to be the Son of God, and also God at the same time. Unbelievers, unable to reconcile it, sometimes dismiss the core doctrine of Christianity for this reason, and even some religions and denominations of Christianity deny the Son of God, his title, God.</p><h6 dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=Psalm&amp;c=2&amp;v=7&amp;o=1">Psalm 2 7</a></h6><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><h6 dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=Psalm&amp;c=110&amp;v=1&amp;o=1">Psalm 110 1</a></h6><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Well, we're going to embrace it and reveal how this can be. I believe we cannot answer, "What is Life?" without embracing this seemingly illogical truth. Firstly, you must know Jesus is the Word being spoken of in the verse <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=John&amp;c=1&amp;v=1&amp;o=1">John Chapter 1, Verse 1</a>. Jesus = the Son of God = the Son of man = the Word = the Word of God = the Life = the Way = the Truth, and among many other names. Yes, he's a man of many names, and I have given Him a new one: the Primitive! Because He is the Light of all lights, the beginning of the creation of God, and the faithful witness of God.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Alright, would you agree that the fruit of love is life? Consider it throughout all creation, though perfect love is the cause that created all things to begin with. It is not perfect love that drives new life among creation, because we often do it through biological hardwires to reproduce, but it's still love. Sweet, romantic love. However, Adam was set apart from the animals. We were called to higher standards. We failed so hard that God had to give us laws, and then we failed even harder because we transgressed the laws. We revolted and desired our own ways. Spoiler alert, God then fulfilled the law, and we witnessed God making a new light, salvation. The king of glory himself created the light of salvation by laying His life on a cross of man, and for man. That is perfect love! So ought we love, as Christ has loved us.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">It's imperative that you understand the relationship between love and life, because God is love. The Love of all love. God is love. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=1+John&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;o=1">1 John Chapter 4, Verse 7-8</a></p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">You believe that God is love? Do you also agree that the fruit of love is life? So the fruit of God is Life. As the scriptures reveal, the first begotten of God is the Son of God. And for as long as God was, so Life was.</p><h6 dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=John&amp;c=3&amp;v=16&amp;o=1">John 3 16</a></h6><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong></p></blockquote><h6 dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=John&amp;c=14&amp;v=6&amp;o=1">John 14 6</a></h6><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</strong></p></blockquote><h3 dir="auto">The Breath of Life</h3><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This is the sustaining breath of life that all the 'living things' of the earth share. We cannot limit this breath of life to inhaling air into our lungs and exhaling. We must imagine a more abstract image that includes the animals of the sea, trees, plants, and organisms, and also includes the transaction of life from one to the other through consumption. It is written that the life of the flesh is in the blood.</p><p dir="auto"></p><h6 dir="auto">The Origin, Multiplication, and Transfer of the Life of Plants and Trees, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/kjv?bt=Genesis&amp;c=1&amp;v=11&amp;o=1">Genesis Chapter 1 Verse 11 - 12</a></h6><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</strong></p></blockquote><h3 dir="auto">Living Life</h3><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">It's that superficial, self-oriented perspective.</p><p dir="auto"></p>
