They both exist in the realm of the unseen, but it is easier to speak of them and more difficult to speak of their very essence, spirit. That's right, both love and life are, in essence, spirit. But what is spirit? Let's see how best we can understand by the end of this article.</p><h1 dir="auto">Unseen or Immaterial?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">It's tempting to begin defining spirit along the lines of 'things unseen'. Spirit is of the unseen realm, but I am a bit reluctant to go there because unseen relative to what? You'd think that 'unseen' implies relativity to eyesight. But by that definition, is oxygen spirit? No, therefore, we must say, 'immaterial'.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Having established that spirit is the things immaterial, we must address the next nuance. The laws of nature are immaterial. So by that definition, are they spirits? I'm hesitant about this. Laws of nature are descriptive, not prescriptive. Spirit must intimately prescribe behavior, not describe it. To continue this exploration. Let us base ourselves on that law.</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Spirit must intimately prescribe behavior, not describe it.</p></li></ol><p dir="auto">The idea is to capture only what is able to influence the character, drive behavior, take possession of personality, and operate independently at will.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">So let's lay out constraints for the essence of spirit. We can use them as checks later on to categorize spirit.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Spirit, immaterial in nature, must be able to:</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Influence character</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Drive behavior</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Take possession of personality</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Operate independently at will</p></li></ol><h1 dir="auto">Form, Formless, and Image</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">We've covered the essence of spirit in the previous part. In short, spirit is the essence; immaterial, determinant of character and behavior. But what is the form thereof? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function">Form follows function</a>. Whatever the form is, it must relate to the function. Consider the form of a man. Now, consider the form of a woman. Are they similar? They are similar, but the man is generally taller, more muscular, tougher, and overall stronger. Therefore, the function of a man is not the function of a woman, though they may ultimately serve the same purpose.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Let us consider two spirits: a warring spirit and a nurturing spirit. Now, imagine caricatures for them individually, depicting their functions.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">There is a clear difference between the two images, right? If you have a visual reference, you can assess the differences with vision, but this is distilled imagination. Imagination is a step closer to the truth, transcending the physical by default. Whatever you want to express visually or in writing, it must first be imagined.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Spiritual forms are multi-dimensional images in a sanctified imagination communicated through a structured symbolic language.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Consider the expression below.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">She has five hands, five feet, with palms for soles, five tongues, large ears, large eyes, a large nose, and five breasts, but a heart in place of her head with long flowing hair and a fair complexion. Yet she is clothed and completely covered by grace and modesty. Her nakedness cannot be seen exactly unless from within her personal space. She is hidden by beauty.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">What form do you have in your imagination? A woman with five breasts? I did say that she is clothed. So then what do you see?</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">The symbolic language communicates her function, but if I were to give a visual image, I would give the image below.</p><p dir="auto"></p><div class="columns" cols="2"><div class="column" index="0"><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><div style="text-align: center;" class="image"><img height="auto" style="" src="https://image.cdn2.seaart.me/2025-06-28/d1fuov5e878c739a8mvg-2/98549a277fb64f7a7df9159ea1a5b92b_high.webp" flipx="false" flipy="false" width="310" align="center" inline="false"></div></p><p dir="auto"></p></div><div class="column" index="1"><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><div style="text-align: center;" class="image"><img height="auto" style="" src="https://image.cdn2.seaart.me/static/upload/20240807/78047e02-18e9-47fa-a46c-36e243606a7f.png" flipx="false" flipy="false" width="448" align="center" inline="false"></div></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p></div></div><p style="text-align: right" dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.seaart.ai/">Images from SeaArt Infinity</a></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Where are her five hands? Where are her five breasts? She is a spirit. She is wisdom, nurturing. All of her five senses are exaggerated for her function. Her thoughts are emotions, and she is clothed in beauty.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This begs the question, "Does form equal image?" I don't think so. What do you think, what is form and what is image? The image is what should be seen when something must be seen visually from a two-dimensional perspective. Form follows the working function, often transcending a two-dimensional perspective.</p><h1 dir="auto">Are all Living beings?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Are all spirits 'living beings'? No, some are ministers, principalities, and powers of darkness. They are dead. Life intrinsically belongs to God.
