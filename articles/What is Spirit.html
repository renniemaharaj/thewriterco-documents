They both exist in the realm of the unseen, but it is easier to speak of them and more difficult to speak of their very essence, spirit. That's right, both love and life are, in essence, spirit. But what is spirit? Let's see how best we can understand by the end of this article.</p><h1 dir="auto">Unseen or Immaterial?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">It's tempting to begin defining spirit along the lines of 'things unseen'. Spirit is of the unseen realm, but I am a bit reluctant to go there because unseen relative to what? You'd think that 'unseen' implies relativity to eyesight. But by that definition, is oxygen spirit? No, therefore, we must say, 'immaterial'.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Having established that spirit is the things immaterial, we must address the next nuance. The laws of nature are immaterial. So by that definition, are they spirits? I'm hesitant about this. Laws of nature are descriptive, not prescriptive. Spirit must intimately prescribe behavior, not describe it. To continue this exploration. Let us base ourselves on that law.</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Spirit must intimately prescribe behavior, not describe it.</p></li></ol><p dir="auto">The idea is to capture only what is able to influence the character, drive behavior, take possession of personality, and operate independently at will.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">So let's lay out constraints for the essence of spirit. We can use them as checks later on to categorize spirit.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Spirit, immaterial in nature, must be able to:</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Influence character</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Drive behavior</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Take possession of personality</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Operate independently at will</p></li></ol><h1 dir="auto">Form, Formless, and Image</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">We've covered the essence of spirit in the previous part. In short, spirit is the essence; immaterial, determinant of character and behavior. But what is the form thereof? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function">Form follows function</a>. Whatever the form is, it must relate to the function. Consider the form of a man. Now, consider the form of a woman. Are they similar? They are similar, but the man is generally taller, more muscular, tougher, and overall stronger. Therefore, the function of a man is not the function of a woman, though they may ultimately serve the same purpose.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Let us consider two spirits: a warring spirit and a nurturing spirit. Now, imagine caricatures for them individually, depicting their functions.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">There is a clear difference between the two images, right? If you have a visual reference, you can assess the differences with vision, but this is distilled imagination. Imagination is a step closer to the truth, transcending the physical by default. Whatever you want to express visually or in writing, it must first be imagined.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Spiritual forms are multi-dimensional images in a sanctified imagination communicated through a structured symbolic language.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Consider the expression below.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">She has five hands, five feet, with palms for soles, five tongues, large ears, large eyes, a large nose, and five breasts, but a heart in place of her head with long flowing hair and a fair complexion. Yet she is clothed and completely covered by grace and modesty. Her nakedness cannot be seen exactly unless from within her personal space. She is hidden by beauty.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">What form do you have in your imagination? A woman with five breasts? I did say that she is clothed. So then what do you see?</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">The symbolic language communicates her function, but if I were to give a visual image, I would give the image below.</p><p dir="auto"><div style="text-align: center;" class="image"><img height="auto" style="" src="https://image.cdn2.seaart.me/2025-06-28/d1fuov5e878c739a8mvg-2/98549a277fb64f7a7df9159ea1a5b92b_high.webp" flipx="false" flipy="false" width="310" align="center" inline="false"></div> </p><p style="text-align: right" dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.seaart.ai/">Images from SeaArt Infinity</a></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Where are her five hands? Where are her five breasts? She is a spirit. She is wisdom, nurturing. All of her five senses are exaggerated for her function. Her thoughts are emotions, and she is clothed in beauty.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This begs the question, "Does form equal image?" I don't think so. What do you think, what is form and what is image? The image is what should be seen when something must be seen visually from a two-dimensional perspective. Form follows the working function, often transcending a two-dimensional perspective.</p><h1 dir="auto">Are all Living beings?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Are all spirits 'living beings'? No, some are ministers, principalities, and powers of darkness. They are dead. Life intrinsically belongs to God. The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Ephesians 6:12</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><em>"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against </em><strong><em>spiritual wickedness in high places</em></strong><em>."</em></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">James 2:26</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><em>"The body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."</em></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This shows that spirit is what animates, but the source of <span style="color: rgb(82, 196, 26)"><strong>true life is</strong></span> still <span style="color: rgb(82, 196, 26)"><strong>God</strong></span>.

You have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead."</em></p></blockquote><h1 dir="auto">The Spirit of God</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">As we've touched on in the previous part, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Life. He is also the Spirit of true Love. He is also the Spirit of Christ. He is also the Spirit of Truth. He is also known as the Holy Spirit / Holy Ghost. In Hebrew, they say, "Ruach Hakodesh." He is the Spirit of the living God. He is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Let us study His fruit below:</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Galatians 5:22-23</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Fruit means what is begotten from intimacy with the spirit. In this case, with the Spirit. The fruit is what is conceived.</p><h1 dir="auto">Principalities</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">These are organized, governed spiritual residences or states and authorities with high influence over the general behavior of the particular area, its air, and according to the individual head. Whereas principalities are rulers, powers are enablers. They move behind the scenes, amplifying or restraining, stirring desires, fears, pride, or love. They can inhabit law, speech, art, or silence.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Example: The principality over Persia (Iran)</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Daniel 10:12-13</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p><p dir="auto">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p></blockquote><h1 dir="auto">Powers</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">These are spiritual potential and influence. They are non-governing.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Examples:</p><ul><li><p dir="auto"><strong>Witchcraft</strong> – the manipulation of will and perception through spiritual means.</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>The Antichrist spirit</strong> – systems, ideologies, and laws that deny or oppose Christ.</p><ul><li><p dir="auto"><em>Examples:</em></p><ul><li><p dir="auto">Laws that criminalize Christian preaching under the banner of “hate speech.”</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Bills that redefine marriage, gender, or the image of man apart from God's design.</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Mandates that prohibit prayer or worship in public spaces.</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Educational reforms that normalize atheism or humanism as superior reasoning.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>Social Media</strong> – a modern tool of tremendous power, capable of spreading truth or deception, grace or vanity, depending on the spirit behind its use.</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>Fear</strong> – can be a dark power (torment, control) or a holy one (the fear of the Lord, which is clean and life-giving).</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>Music and Art</strong> – carriers of either heaven's beauty or hell’s distortion, depending on the spirit that inspires them.</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>The Love of God</strong> – a divine power that draws men to repentance (Romans 2:4), transforms hearts, and births eternal life.</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><strong>Grace</strong> – not merely forgiveness, but divine enablement; the power to live righteously and overcome sin (Titus 2:11–12).</p></li></ul><h1 dir="auto">What Constitutes Unclean?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Any spiritual minister, principality, or power is unclean when it opposes and rebels against the will and work of the living God.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">1 John 4:1-3</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</p><p dir="auto">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.</p><p dir="auto">And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and such is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now already it is in the world.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p>
