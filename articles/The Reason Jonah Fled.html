However, his relationship with God, as revealed through just four chapters, is pure gold — a real treasure to have and an honor to study. It's quite entertaining. However, before we continue, let me clarify that my em dashes are quite intentional and not a sign of AI-generated writing. I'll admit, I learned them through 'chat gippitty', but man, ever since I started using them, I can't quit. It's like that external mouse you never knew you needed — now you can't even right-click a folder using your trackpad anymore. As opposed to commas, they make the difference when it comes to spacing out my expressions.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Free the em dashes!</p><h1 dir="auto">The Narrative</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Alright, now that we have that out of the way, have you studied the book of Jonah before? I thought that I knew the story of Jonah until I took the time to study it recently. I realized that there's a much bigger picture than Jonah, the prophet, fleeing from the presence of God, tossed in the ocean, swallowed up by a great fish, repenting, and ultimately surrendering to God. By that narrative, the story appears to be about obedience, and while that narrative isn't far from the truth, it doesn't do justice either.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah didn't flee due to his fear of Nineveh — or any fear, as you would think, for that matter. I mean, the guy fled from the presence of God — he slept through the storm, proposed that he should be tossed overboard, was swallowed by a great fish, and yet, dared to argue with the <strong>Most High God</strong>. Albeit, I wouldn't say that Jonah disrespected God. I think that their relationship was particular. A relationship that uniquely reveals more of God's personality and his interactions with man. To understand the true story of Jonah, we have to begin at chapter 1, verse 1.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><div style="text-align: center;" class="image"><img height="auto" style="" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ff/ed/df/ffeddfe74e93e10c021bf90932b015a5.jpg" flipx="false" flipy="false" align="center" inline="false"></div></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><h1 dir="auto">The Book of Jonah</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 1:1-2</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">(1:1) Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, (1:2)<span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)"> Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Around 800 BC, 800 years before Christ Jesus, God spoke to the prophet Jonah, instructing him to go to the city of Nineveh and cry unto it. "For their wickedness is come up before me", God said. However, God didn't know that Jonah was on vacation. Jonah had other plans.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 1:3</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah fled from the presence of the LORD. He what? Jonah didn't know that the presence of the LORD was (is) the vocation—His spirit is. King David knew that.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Psalm 139:7-11</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">(139:7) Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? (139:8) If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. (139:9) <strong>If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; </strong>(139:10) Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. (139:11) If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah was going to find out very quickly that we truly cannot escape God's reach. I perceive that he knew that, but fled anyway. Now, God stirred up the sea, and the mariners knew that it had to be the hand of God. They woke Jonah, and Jonah told them that he had fled from the God who made the sea and land. They ultimately believed in Jonah's God and cast Jonah overboard. It's safe to say that Jonah had intended to drown and die (Judging by later remarks).</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 4:3</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 4:8-9</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">(4:8) And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. (4:9) And God said to Jonah, <span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)">Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?</span> And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">However, God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 1:17</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">God had other plans; He intended to use even Jonah's story.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Matthew 12:38-41</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">(12:38) Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. (12:39) But he answered and said unto them, <span style="color: #F5222D">An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: </span>(12:40) <span style="color: #F5222D"><strong>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</strong></span><strong> </strong>(12:41) <span style="color: #F5222D">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:</span> <span style="color: #F5222D">because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">The connections are eye-opening, aren't they? Jonah then cried out to the LORD his God out of the fish's belly.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 2:1-10</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">(2:1) Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, (2:2) And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. (2:3) For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. (2:4) Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. (2:5) The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.(2:6) <strong>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</strong>(2:7) When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. (2:8) They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. (2:9) B<strong>ut I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. </strong>(2:10) And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p></blockquote><h1 dir="auto">Why Did Jonah Flee?</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Then the word of God came to Jonah again, and this time he went. He cried to Nineveh, they repented, and God repented.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 3:1-5</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">(3:1) And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, (3:2)<span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)"> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</span> (3:3) So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. (3:4) And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. (3:5) So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This displeased Jonah, and we see why Jonah fled.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 4:1-5</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">(4:1) But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. (4:2) <strong>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</strong> (4:3) Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. (4:4) <span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)">Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</span> (4:5) So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">So Jonah fled not out of fear for Nineveh, but because he knew that Nineveh would repent, and God would repent. Knowing that God is a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">If anything, the story of Jonah is a testament to God's ridiculous goodness, so good that it even sometimes provokes his servants and prophets. God is good.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Jonah 4:6-10</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">(4:6) And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. (4:7) But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. (4:8) And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. (4:9) <span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? </span>And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. (4:10) Then said the LORD, <span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)"><strong>Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</strong> </span>(4:11)<span style="color: rgb(245, 34, 45)"> <strong>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</strong></span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Nineveh, that great city, fell again into its ways and was destroyed after many years. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nineveh_(612_BC)">Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)</a>. 612 years before Christ Jesus.</p>
