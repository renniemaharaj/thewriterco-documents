Some of us are so sensitive that we discern through digital presentations, and the most sensitive among us even flag our own.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Galatians 2:11-14</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto"><strong>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</strong></p><p dir="auto">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p><p dir="auto">And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p><p dir="auto">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">This is not a major concern. The same Spirit that discerns is the same Spirit who is able to witness for the believer, and through that believer, conceiving His fruit that testifies, and assures the discerning believer.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Galatians 5:22-23</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">In theory, but it is not always this straightforward, and sometimes, due to the same Spirit's perfect work in us, the sanctification process can cause an inward wrestling that lasts for even years. This is why the last, though no less important, aspect of the armor of God is an exhortation that transitions from metaphor to functional application. Although not a metaphorical part of the armor itself, praying in the Spirit of Truth greatly enhances the armor’s effectiveness and endurance in spiritual warfare.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Ephesians 6:14-18</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</p><p dir="auto">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p><p dir="auto">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</p><p dir="auto">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p><p dir="auto"><strong>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><div style="text-align: center;" class="image"><img height="auto" style="" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/05/74/1b/05741bc328db342778ab9a13611b6d1f.jpg" flipx="false" flipy="false" align="center" inline="false"></div></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"></p><h1 dir="auto">A Call to Reflection</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Believer, how strong is your belief? Is it a mere belief? How do you know that your God is true? This is crucial to know, life and death, because for one:</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">1 Peter 5:8</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Be sober, be vigilant; because <strong>your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</strong></p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">In Lord Jesus's words:</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower:</p><p dir="auto"><strong>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.</strong></p><p dir="auto">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the Word and at once with joy receiveth it;</p><p dir="auto">yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while. For when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the Word, by and by he loses faith.</p><p dir="auto">He also that received the seed among the thorns is he that heareth the Word; and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p><p dir="auto">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word and understandeth it; who also beareth fruit and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.”</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Finally, again, it is imperative for you yourself to be well-grounded in your belief. What does it mean to be well-grounded, to never fall? This is preferable, but the darkness of this world is not first 'outward consequences', but first in 'the heart'. The darkness of these end times is antichrist, because Christ is the light who fulfilled the old things. Not abolished, but fulfilled. Then, if he is the light:</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">John 14:6</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">Jesus said unto him, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Then there is no other darkness in the world besides refusing Him. If all did believe and convert, then what darkness would there be left? There would be none. The only darkness of these end times is the antichrist spirit.</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Therefore, your enemy is the antichrist spirit. Consider the parallels of a traditional marriage vow with converting:</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">I, _____, take thee, _____, to be my wedded wife (husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">If your spirit must be superficial, then your commitment to Christ must be taken as the wedding vow above, except with the ending, 'till the death of my flesh, make us one forever, Amen.' And 'Christ', for 'wedded wife (husband)'.</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">I, _____, take thee, Lord Jesus,, to be my Christ, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till the death of my flesh, make us one forever, Amen</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">I am not saying to take this vow. I'm saying for superficiality sake, your commitment must be as taking a vow, but there is a greater spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Truth. It is He who is truly able to comfort you through the 'for poorer', and convicts through the vanity of 'the richer'. It is he who enables you to love Christ, having been loved of Christ first and bearing the love of God in you. It is He who draws to your attention the little things worth appreciating.</p><h1 dir="auto">Conclusion</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Great. In the last part, we reflected on our faith. We distinguished superficial belief from Spirit-driven belief. Are you Spirit-driven? That is to ask, are you born again of the Spirit? Have you heard and believed the gospel?</p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">John 3:16</p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p dir="auto">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p></blockquote><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Do you believe that Jesus, the Christ from Nazareth, was God in the flesh who lived and gave His life for the sins of the world?</p><p dir="auto"></p>
