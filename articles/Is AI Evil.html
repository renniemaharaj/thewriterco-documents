Greetings!<br><br>I diligently labor in the field of my profession, software development, and not for my own profit. I develop tools which serve me and my faith; my relationship with God, but I am called here to share: godly, edifying devices, and these same tools so you too can benefit from my gifts.<br><br>Fellow people of God, this document, I pen it with a troubled heart. Penned, not with plastic and ink, but with a heartfelt, genuine concern for you, and for all who will use my tools-which, as you may know, are sometimes integrated and powered by artificial intelligence.<br><br>My heart is troubled by those who speak uncertainty; who speak that which they do not understand, speaking on the highly sensitive nature of Artificial Intelligence without understanding it themselves. Who are they? Those who you call your very brothers and sisters in Christ. It is not the secular or unbelieving man who speak these, but believers in Christ and some who speak conspiracy theories, and they themselves are against the Lord Jesus.<br><br>Hence, I make this effort to, rather than drink from your cup of corruption, share insight into the technology, and provide bases for your sound, undefiled conscience. Your Defiled conscience is more concerning than how darkness itself may use this tool, if not by this very defiling of your conscience. Because you're viewing technology through the lens of ignorance, though understandably so. The marketing is deceiving.</strong></span></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto"><strong>Explaining Artificial Intelligence</strong></h1><p dir="auto"><strong><br></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif"><strong>Marketing is deceiving! Artificial Intelligence does not think, but it processes information, predicting by patterns and sequences, made possible by your own data which you voluntarily contributed if you have ever written or recorded content on the internet. It is a shadow of your data. Do not take its sophisticated systems for genuine thought. As of now, it is still very error prone, it malfunctions and the algorithms behind are completely dependent on human intervention; training, and maintenance!</strong></span></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto"><strong>A Call for Neutrality</strong></h1><p dir="auto"><strong><br></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif"><strong>Artificial Intelligence, much like every other human product, is not inherently good or evil in itself alone, but may be used for either.

How can something so foolish be said by a Christian? Do not give Satan the liberty of taking God's word out of context. This is a dangerous thing you have said and done, linking the place AI to 666 through speculation. Then linking this back to Artificial Intelligence, proposing that it may be connected to the image of the beast in Revelation 13.<br><br>While technology like AI might potentially play a role in fulfilling end-times prophecy concerning the image of the beast, we must be cautious not to force interpretations based on speculative numerical patterns found in the English text. Such methods lack clear scriptural support and can distract from the true message. We should focus on understanding prophecy through careful study of the Word in its proper context, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, rather than relying on methods prone to human error and subjective interpretation. no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

The speaker discusses patterns related to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the number 666 in the King James Bible: - AI appears 36 times in the Bible - AI + beast = 216 mentions (6 x 6 x 6) - AI + "600 + three score + 6" = 396 mentions (66 x 6) - AI + beast + wildcard six = 666 mentions<br><br>2. The speaker connects these patterns to Biblical prophecy, particularly: - Revelation 13:15 about the "image of the beast" - The possibility that AI could be this prophesied image - The significance of the number 666 in relation to the beast<br><br>3. Other numerical patterns discussed: - Solomon and 666 talents of gold - Nebuchadnezzar's image dimensions (60 cubits by 6 cubits) - Various patterns involving "three score" (60) and the number 666<br><br>4. The speaker argues these patterns demonstrate divine design in the King James Bible translation, particularly through: - The consistent use of "three score" vs "60" - The first appearance of "three score" in the 666th verse - Multiple overlapping numerical patterns<br><br>5. Contemporary concerns: - The rapid advancement of AI technology - Potential implications for Christianity and worship - Questions about AI's role in religious functions like sermons and hymn writing The speaker presents these patterns as evidence of biblical prophecy potentially relating to modern AI development, while emphasizing uncertainty about specific timing of prophetic fulfillment.</strong></span></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p dir="auto"><strong><br></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif"><strong>Fellow people of God.
