Greetings!<br><br>I diligently labor in the field of my profession, software development, and not for my own profit. I develop tools which serve me and my faith; my relationship with God, but I am called here to share: godly, edifying devices, and these same tools so you too can benefit from my gifts.<br><br>Fellow people of God, this document, I pen it with a troubled heart. Penned, not with plastic and ink, but with a heartfelt, genuine concern for you, and for all who will use my tools-which, as you may know, are sometimes integrated and powered by artificial intelligence.<br><br>My heart is troubled by those who speak of uncertainty; who speak that which they do not understand, speaking on the highly sensitive nature of Artificial Intelligence without understanding it themselves. Who are they? Those whom you call your very brothers and sisters in Christ. It is not the secular or unbelieving man who speaks these, but believers in Christ and some who speak conspiracy theories, and they themselves are against the Lord Jesus.<br><br>Hence, I make this effort to, rather than drink from your cup of corruption, share insight into the technology, and provide bases for your sound, undefiled conscience. Your Defiled conscience is more concerning than how darkness itself may use this tool, if not by this very defiling of your conscience. Because you're viewing technology through the lens of ignorance, though understandably so. The marketing is deceiving.</span></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto">Explaining Artificial Intelligence</h1><p dir="auto"><br><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Marketing is deceiving! Artificial Intelligence does not think, but it processes information, predicting by patterns and sequences, made possible by your own data, which you voluntarily contributed if you have ever written or recorded content on the internet. It is a shadow of your data. Do not take its sophisticated systems for genuine thought. As of now, it is still very error-prone, it malfunctions, and the algorithms behind it are completely dependent on human intervention, training, and maintenance!</span></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto">A Call for Neutrality</h1><p dir="auto"><br><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Artificial Intelligence, much like every other human product, is not inherently good or evil in itself, but may be used for either. Its ethical alignment depends entirely on the intentions and actions of its human creators and users. In our implementations, we use a framework which was built in order to serve as a final filter and guide the model's output towards consistency with our axioms: God is, KJV as an authoritative written source, and Jesus is Truth! Even our </span><a target="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.thewriterco.com/reasoning">reasoning/rationale</a></p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto">Reject Speculative Numerology</h1><p dir="auto"><br><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Do not take God's word out of context, saying, "God often speaks out of context in his word." How can something so foolish be said by a Christian? Do not give Satan the liberty of taking God's word out of context. This is a dangerous thing you have said and done, linking the place AI to 666 through speculation. Then linking this back to Artificial Intelligence, proposing that it may be connected to the image of the beast in Revelation 13.<br><br>While technology like AI might potentially play a role in fulfilling end-times prophecy concerning the image of the beast, we must be cautious not to force interpretations based on speculative numerical patterns found in the English text. Such methods lack clear scriptural support and can distract from the true message. We should focus on understanding prophecy through careful study of the Word in its proper context, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, rather than relying on methods prone to human error and subjective interpretation. no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. </span></p><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Please consider the embedded </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYEVZN-PrqU">video</a>.</p><p dir="auto"></p><iframe class="iframe" width="562" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYEVZN-PrqU" defaultshowpicker="false" frameborder="0"></iframe><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif"><br></span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Below is an AI-generated transcript of the video (Isn't AI helpful when used for good?)</span></p><p dir="auto"></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><ol><li><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">The speaker discusses patterns related to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the number 666 in the King James Bible: - AI appears 36 times in the Bible - AI + beast = 216 mentions (6 x 6 x 6) - AI + "600 + three score + 6" = 396 mentions (66 x 6) - AI + beast + wildcard six = 666 mentions<br></span></p></li><li><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">The speaker connects these patterns to Biblical prophecy, particularly: - Revelation 13:15 about the "image of the beast" - The possibility that AI could be this prophesied image - The significance of the number 666 in relation to the beast<br></span></p></li><li><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Other numerical patterns discussed: - Solomon and 666 talents of gold - Nebuchadnezzar's image dimensions (60 cubits by 6 cubits) - Various patterns involving "three score" (60) and the number 666<br></span></p></li><li><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">The speaker argues these patterns demonstrate divine design in the King James Bible translation, particularly through: - The consistent use of "three score" vs "60" - The first appearance of "three score" in the 666th verse - Multiple overlapping numerical patterns<br></span></p></li><li><p dir="auto"><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">Contemporary concerns: - The rapid advancement of AI technology - Potential implications for Christianity and worship - Questions about AI's role in religious functions like sermons and hymn writing The speaker presents these patterns as evidence of biblical prophecy potentially relating to modern AI development, while emphasizing uncertainty about specific timing of prophetic fulfillment.</span></p></li></ol></blockquote><h1 dir="auto">Elephant in the Room</h1><p dir="auto"></p><p dir="auto">Let's address the elephant in the room. The real evil isn't a tool, but rather, man's fallen state. When assessing the danger of AI, we must refer to existing tools of warfare, the sword, to sum it up. Artificial Intelligence, like every weapon against man, cannot do what it was not explicitly designed to do. Artificial Intelligence does not have free will. Therefore, the danger with Artificial Intelligence is nothing more than with its agency, its general purpose design, and its system instructions. Non-technical people, what is the difference between an AI model and the processing unit of a computer? The difference is: one accepts code, while the other accepts pure English as its high-level prompt. This gives it the impression of having life, but you'd be surprised to know that structured languages are predictable, with answers to questions and cadences.</p><h1 style="line-height: 26.4px" dir="auto">Conclusion</h1><p dir="auto"><br><span style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Serif&quot;, serif">So what am I saying? I am saying, if you must fear, fear what man will do with the tool, and if you must fear what man will do with AI, then have the same amount of fear for a man wielding his sword. Both are lifeless tools, though one gives the impression of being alive.</span></p>
